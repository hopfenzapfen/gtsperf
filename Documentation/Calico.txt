Due to the way the virtual machines are provisioned in GTS, it is impossible to create a fully functional meshed topology as depicted in figure [FIGURE] with Calico. The BIRD routing daemon refuses to import a route from the kernel if the next-hop is not in a directly connected network. This means that only physically connected networks can be included in the routing table as a correct BGP route. A workaround in order to include all links between all sites would be to issue a route to specify the vNIC as onlink. By issuing this next hop flag (NHFLAG) with the \texttt{ip} command, the networking stack will pretend that the nexthop is directly attached to the given link, even if it does not match any interface prefix. 

This NHFLAG parameter essentially instructs the kernel to treat the route as a connected network. Specifying this option returns that the NHFLAG is an invalid argument for the specified interface. This means that we were able to exclusively create a point to point topology between sites with Calico as the onlink limitation does not apply in this scenario.
